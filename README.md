Uncovering Insights in the Hospitality Industry with Python and Pandas

AtliQ Grands, a well-established hotel chain with a legacy spanning almost two decades, has been providing exceptional hospitality experiences across various cities in India, including Mumbai and Bangalore. Offering diverse room categories, from Standard to Presidential, AtliQ Grands has become a go-to choice for travelers. Whether you book through MakeYourTrip, LogTrip, Tripster, AtliqGrands.com, or opt for the traditional offline booking route, they are dedicated to ensuring your stay is unforgettable.

Recently, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project for AtliQ Grands. The objective was to analyze their extensive dataset, get valuable insights, and present them in a clear and impactful manner. Here's a sneak peek into some of the key findings and actions I took to achieve them:

1. Average Room Occupancy Rates: I calculated the average occupancy rate for each room category, shedding light on the popularity of different room types.

2. City-wise Occupancy Rates: Understanding the demand for AtliQ Grands' offerings in different cities, I presented average occupancy rates for each location.

3. Weekdays vs. Weekends: I examined data to determine whether the occupancy rates were better on weekdays or weekends, helping AtliQ Grands optimize pricing and promotions.

4. June Occupancy Trends: Creating insightful bar charts, I showcased how occupancy rates varied across cities during the month of June.

5. August Data Integration: When new data for August arrived, I seamlessly appended it to the existing dataset, ensuring data continuity for future analysis.

6. Revenue by City: Calculating revenue realized per city, I revealed the financial performance of each location.

This project underscores the power of data analytics, Python, and Pandas in the hospitality domain. By getting these insights, AtliQ Grands can enhance their service quality, optimize pricing, and improve customer experiences.

I'm incredibly proud of the results, and I look forward to discussing this project with my network in more detail. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to learn more about the project. Exciting things are happening in the world of data analytics, and I'm thrilled to be a part of it.ðŸ“ˆ #DataAnalytics #Hospitality #Python #Pandas #DataInsights
